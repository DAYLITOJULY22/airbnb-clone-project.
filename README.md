   - Projects: Calculator app, personal expense tracker.

2. Web Basics
   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript fundamentals.
   - Project: Personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages.

3. Databases
   - SQL basics (CRUD, joins).
   - Project: Store/query user data in expense tracker.

4. Version Control
   - Git & GitHub (commits, branching, pull requests).
   - Practice: All projects stored on GitHub.
Phase 2: Applied Development (6–12 months)
Goal: Solve real-world problems and learn collaboration.
